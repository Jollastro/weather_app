# Weather App

### Author: Davide Balducci

<br />

### The code is commented and pretty much self-explanatory

<br />

- ✅ Tests are under [test](test/)

- ✅ The uml file is in [myUml.svg](out/uml/myUml.svg)

<br />

## Native Sections:

<br />

- ⬜️ IOS:

I didn't write the native ios code because I'm not able to do it yet, and mostly because these days in my company I don't have access to the mac to do it (while learning it)

<br />

- ✅ Android:

The android native view (activity) has been written and it's reachable from the button on the app bar

<br />

## Possible improvements with more time:

<br />

- localization,
- theme selection,
- coordinates selection,
- improved UI
- improved test section.
